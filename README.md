# Smart Class

A Flutter app that will send images to an API, the API will classify the level of engagement of the student and save the result to a small Database.
Later on, the API will provide the app with an endpoint to have a metric report of the engagement throughout the class.


## Detailed information

First off, I made some designs using Figma. Those can be viewed here:

```HTML
<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FpB7TcjGzSjkruTI1cV6GVj%2FSmartClass-API-Consumer%3Fnode-id%3D13%253A576" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

At the moment of writing, still need to add code that implements complete desired functionality. 
Latest commit will get you up to speed with where I am at.
