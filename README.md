# Smart Class

A Flutter app that will send images to an API, the API will classify the level of engagement of the student and save the result to a small Database.
Later on, the API will provide the app with an endpoint to have a metric report of the engagement throughout the class.


## Detailed information

First off, I made some designs using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pB7TcjGzSjkruTI1cV6GVj/SmartClass-API-Consumer?node-id=13%3A576).
At the moment of writing, still need to add code that implements complete desired functionality. 
Latest commit will get you up to speed with where I am at. And then I will fully update this section of the readME. :grin:
